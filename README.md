# Dechinesator

## Description:

This is a tool which I made for myself to read my Chinese texts in more convenient way. I'm studying Chinese and I got tired of tiny Chinese texts around the web which cause my eyes to bleed. So I made a tool where I put my copy-pasted Chinese and read it using big characters. And it uses third party Chengyu database to highlight chengyu - by these guys: https://github.com/MegamindHenry/chengyu-dictionary.
